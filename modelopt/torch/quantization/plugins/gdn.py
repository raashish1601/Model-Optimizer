"""Fake quantization of the GatedDeltaNet (GDN) recurrent state.

The chunked gated-delta-rule kernel keeps each head's ``[K, V]`` recurrent state in fp32 inside
one Triton launch and carries it from chunk to chunk. To emulate a deployment that stores that
state in FP8 or INT8, ModelOpt runs an adapted copy of the kernel
(:mod:`modelopt.torch.kernels.quantization.linear_attention`) that fake-quantizes the state to
E4M3 or signed narrow-range INT8 at the end of every chunk, with a scale computed inside the
kernel from the state itself.
The backward pass recomputes the same quantized states and passes the state gradient straight
through the quantization, so QAT and QAD train against the quantized recurrence. A second
quantizer covers ``w``, the WY-transformed keys that multiply the state; ``w`` is a regular tensor,
so it is fake-quantized by the ``TensorQuantizer`` itself before the kernel reads it.
