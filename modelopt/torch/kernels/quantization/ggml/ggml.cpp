// Every GGML IQ format shares common.cuh, the same CUDA version gate, and the same build flags,
// so they compile into one extension and bind here. Each IQ format keeps its block layout in its
// own translation unit, on the encoder its family shares (iq1_family.cuh or iq2_family.cuh), and
// exposes a packer and an unpacker.
